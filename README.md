### Description

The reason for building this specific project was the need for an application that displays the weather outlook for a selected city.

The OpenWeather API was used for retrieving the current day's temperature, humidity, wind speed, and uv index. It was also used to display the temperature and humidity for the following 5 days.

- Below that you will view the forecast for the following five days. Each day will display the date, temp, humidity, and an icon representing the weather conditions.
